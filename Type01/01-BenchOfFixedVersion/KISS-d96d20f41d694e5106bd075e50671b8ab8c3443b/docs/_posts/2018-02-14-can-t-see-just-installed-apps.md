When you install a new app, KISS relies on the device to be notified that the app list has changed.

Sadly, some devices don't broadcast this change properly, and you'll have to manually restart KISS to pick up the change. You can do so by going to `⋮, KISS Settings, Advanced settings, Restart KISS`.

> Please note that some apps don't provide a "launcher intent", which means they can't be opened from the launcher. This typically includes themes, assistant apps, alternative lock screens or Watch Faces.

If the app still doesn't appear, make sure you haven't excluded it previously. Visit `⋮, KISS Settings, History settings, View or edit your excluded apps` and make sure the new app isn't on the list.
