What you CAN do:
  * download the code
  * modify the code
  * upload a FREE copy of your software online (Play Store, F-Droid, ...)
  
What you MUST do:
  * if you distribute a free copy of your work online (GitHub, Play Store, F-Droid, ...) you have to specify:
    # a link to the original project source code
    # a link to the original project Play Store page (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ohi.andre.consolelauncher&hl=en)
    # the name of the original author (Francesco Andreuzzi from Trieste, Italy)
    
What you CAN'T do:
  * upload a PAID copy of your work online
  * use the name 't-ui' or 'Linux CLI Launcher' to distribute your FREE software (I don't want t-ui to be related to some malware software around the web...)
  * spam your software excessively under official t-ui channels (Telegram, Reddit, ...).
