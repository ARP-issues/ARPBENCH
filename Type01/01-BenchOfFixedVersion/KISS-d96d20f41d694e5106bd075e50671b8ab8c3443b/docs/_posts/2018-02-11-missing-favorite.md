This will happen if the favorite isn't available to KISS anymore, for instance:

* The app was uninstalled
* The app was on an SD card that isn't available anymore
* The contact was merged with someone else or removed

To fix this issue, you'll need to remove all your favorites (`â‹®, KISS Settings, Favorites settings, Reset your list of favorites`) and add them back.
