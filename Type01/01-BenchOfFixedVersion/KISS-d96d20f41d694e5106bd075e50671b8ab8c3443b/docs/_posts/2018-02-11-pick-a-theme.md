KISS comes with 6 pre-defined themes:

* Light theme, which is the theme enabled by default
* Semi-transparent theme, a small deviation from the light theme which lets you see part of your wallpaper
* Transparent theme, where you can completely see the wallpaper, but might have issues reading your app names on dark wallpapers
* Dark theme, if you like vampires and low luminosity
* Dark-semi-transparent theme, to dim your wallpaper
* Dark transparent theme, for really light wallpapers

Not all themes will work correctly with all wallpapers, make sure you pick a theme that you like, and that doesn't block legibility!

To change your theme, click `â‹®, KISS Settings, User interface, Theme interface`.

Below is a preview of the built-in themes.
