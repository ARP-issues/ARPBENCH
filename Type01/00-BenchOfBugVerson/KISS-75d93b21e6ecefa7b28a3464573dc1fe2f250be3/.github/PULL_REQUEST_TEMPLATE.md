Thanks for taking the time to make KISS better by contributing code!

Before you open the pull request, please make sure that:

* Your pull request title is clear enough -- ideally, reading the title should be enough to understand the content
* Your description explains what you're trying to do (ideally referencing some existing issues)
* If you made any tradeoffs, please mention them and explain why you think they were necessary
* Include screenshots of your changes
* If you add something slightly complex, feel free to create [a new documentation page](https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/tree/master/docs/_posts), users will thank you for that!
